# soccer-simulation

## description
This project intends to create and analyse a dataset containing match-player level data of soccer matches from five leagues (Bundesliga, LaLiga, Ligue1, Premier League, Serie A) in one season (2016-2017). The idea is to predict player-level stats (e. g.: assists, goals, tackles, etc ...) based on player abilities (measured as fifa ratings). So far data collection, merging, wrangling and cleaning are done. Predictions are yet to come.

## use
Typing `make` in the shell should run all codes and create the `temp` and `output` data files 1, from `input` files (*not uploaded to git*) and 2, from files downloaded directly to `temp` with `wget`.
